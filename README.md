# Important Note

Unfortunately, [Twitter has depreciated 'Elevated' free tier for APIs access](https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1641222782594990080?s=20), on which this project heavily reles. The new 'baisc' tier is charging $100/ month. Today (04/14/2023), a notice from Twitter dev comes in, that this Twitter-dependent application is suspended because of the new API policy. Therefore, the development of this project will be suspended as they claimed and no longer maintained.
